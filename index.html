<h3 class="redbg">What is EWU 2024?</h3>

<section class="introtext">

  <p class="largerspan">EWU 2024 is a collaborative effort to help create a better undergraduate experience at Eastern Washington University. The goal of the project was to take a look at the traditional university structure and discover ways to adjust it for the needs of modern students. By utilizing modern technology and by using the tightly woven community of Spokane, the university sought a way to faciltate student learning and collaboration in ways that pushed the limits of what a secondary education means.</strong></p>

      In April of 2019, a survey and timeline activity was provided to approximately 30 students at the EWU dormitories. Online research of other universities showed that some were already using lecture capture technology to allow students to watch lectures from home, which provided them with a competitive advantage.

      <h3>So we listened!</h3>
      <p>Tech-heavy features were tested in the then under construction Catalyst building.</p>
      <p>The university took advantage of the Palouse Prairie Restoration Project and used it as the first major interdisciplinary project.</p>
      <p>The university slowly experimented with different approaches to flexible class scheduling, taking into account student feedback and departmental needs.</p>
      <p>Classrooms were more thoroughly connected to the internet and utilized streaming services in order to allow students to attend class- event when they can't make it.</p>

      <h3>From:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The daily lives of students causes many issues when they try to fit into rigid class schedules, causing students to have to retake classes or drop out of school
        </li>
        <li>
          Students of different disciplines rarely get an opportunity to interact academically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students not feeling prepared for workforce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Archived online lectures paired with not being graded on attendance give students the resources to succeed no matter what may come up in their at-home lives.

      <ul>
        <li>Students can build school around their life with flexible class scheduling, allowing students the opportunity to complete their degree.
          </li>
        <li>Interdisciplinary industry projects help students learn about other disciplines while working on real-world projects.
          </li>
        <li>Local business involvement in senior coursework improves student knowledge of real-world business. 
          </li>
          <li>Interdisciplinary project as a graduation requirement benefits the students, giving a better understanding of skills needed in the workforce, as well as an understanding of how to work with a variety of departments in the workplace.</li>

<p>On-campus classes offered as a 4x week option with students only needing to attend 2 of the classes. The same lecture would be done twice a week, this could all be done by one professor or by two professors splitting the time.</p>

<img class="nonheader" src="img/flex-schedules.png" alt="Flexible Scheduling">

              <p>Classes would be partially online, with classroom lectures being live-streamed so that any students not able to make it to class could watch from home. These lectures would also be archived online so that students could watch them later in the day or at another date so that they are still caught up on exactly what was covered in class.
                </p>
              <p>How tests/quizzes are administered are up to the individual professor. They can either be done on campus or from home using an online proctoring service at the discretion of the professor.

              <p>On-campus attendance is no longer part of the grading system. Professors have the option to require students to watch the archived lectures if they miss a class, with the at-home streaming service logging when a student watches a lecture. It’s up to a student to make prior arrangements if they can’t make it to campus for a required quiz/test day.

                      <p>Palouse Prairie Restoration Project was the catalyst that brought different majors out of their silos. Erik Budsberg, EWU’s Sustainability Coordinator, made it a goal when he pitched the project to make it a collaborative effort with the community and Spokane tribe. However, he wanted to expand this idea of collaboration and community into the university environment itself, turning to different academic departments in order to get the whole university working towards restoring the Palouse Prairie. He recruited biologists, geologists, chemists, designers, geographers, and even proposed an amphitheater that would give music and theatre students a chance to participate in the project. </p>
