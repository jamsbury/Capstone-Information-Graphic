<h3 class="redbg">What is EWU 2024?</h3>

<section class="introtext">

  <p class="largerspan">EWU 2024 is a collaborative effort to help create a better undergraduate experience at Eastern Washington University. The goal of the project is to take a look at the traditional university structure and discover ways to adjust it for the needs of modern students. By utilizing modern technology and using the tightly woven community of Spokane, the university can find a way to faciltate student learning and collaboration in ways that push the limits of what a secondary education means.</strong></p>

      In April of 2019, a survey and timeline activity was provided to approximately 30 students at the EWU dormitories. This research helped to find what was working well at EWU, as well as the main points that students wanted to see improvement in. The majority of students wanted a more customizable university experience. The main points being: <br/>
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Many students have other obligations, such as family and work that can impede on their school time.</li>
      <li>Students feeling unprepared for the interdisciplinary nature of the modern workforce.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
      Online research was also conducted and showed that classes can be more customizable for students if they have a way to access the coursework from home without missing out on lectures. Many universities were already using lecture capture technology to allow students to watch lectures from home, which provided a better opportunity for students to be able to complete not only their classes, but their degree as well.

      <h5>Flexible Class Schedules:</h5>
      <p>The university slowly experimented with different approaches to flexible class scheduling, taking into account student feedback and departmental needs.</p>
      <p>Classrooms were more thoroughly connected to the internet and utilized streaming services in order to allow students to attend class - even when they can't make it.</p>
      <p>The lecture streaming project was tested in the then under-construction Catalyst building.</p>
      
      <h5>Interdisciplinary Coursework:</h5>
      <p>EWU applied an interdisciplinary approach to Senior Projects to allow students an opportunity to see what a real-world workplace is like, where they would be working together with various departments.</p>
      <p>The university took advantage of the Palouse Prairie Restoration Project and used it as the first major interdisciplinary project.</p>

              <p>Classes would be partially online, with classroom lectures being live-streamed so that any students not able to make it to class could watch from home. These lectures would also be archived online so that students could watch them later in the day or at another date so that they are still caught up on exactly what was covered in class.
                </p>
              <p>How tests/quizzes are administered are up to the individual professor. They can either be done on campus or from home using an online proctoring service at the discretion of the professor.

                      <p>The Palouse Prairie Restoration Project was the catalyst that brought different majors out of their silos. Erik Budsberg, EWU’s Sustainability Coordinator, made it a goal when he pitched the project to make it a collaborative effort with the community and Spokane tribe. However, he wanted to expand this idea of collaboration and community into the university environment itself, turning to different academic departments in order to get the whole university working towards restoring the Palouse Prairie. He recruited biologists, geologists, chemists, designers, geographers, and even proposed an amphitheater that would give music and theatre students a chance to participate in the project. </p>
